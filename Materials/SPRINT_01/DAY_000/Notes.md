# Sprint 01 | Day 000

## âœ… Topics Covered
- Topic 1: Static vs Non-static
- Topic 2: Access Modifiers
- Topic 3: understanding public static main void(String[] arg)
- Topic 4: Class vs Object vs Method
- Topic 5: Typecasting - Implicit Type Casting (Widening), Explicit Type Casting (Narrowing)

## âœ… Key Takeaways
- `static` methods can be called with ClassName.method().
- Instance methods require object creation.
- Access modifiers control visibility across classes, packages, and inheritance.

## ðŸ§  Interview-Oriented Notes
- Always prefer `private` fields + `public` getters/setters for encapsulation.
- Utility/helper classes usually only contain static methods.
- Package-level access (default) is often ignored, but useful in restricted internal use.
