# Practice Challenges for Today

1. Variable Scopes and Types:
   * Create a Java program with all three types of variables (local, instance, static). Print out the values of each type and explain their behavior when the program runs.
2. final Keyword:
   * Declare a final variable and attempt to reassign it. Observe what happens and explain the error.
   * Create a final method in a class and try to override it in a subclass. Explain what happens.
   * Make a final class and attempt to extend it in another class.
3. Escape Sequences:
   * Write a Java program that prints a formatted message using escape sequences like \n (new line), \t (tab), and others. Try combining multiple escape sequences in a single string.
4. Type Casting:
   * Practice both explicit and implicit type casting.
5. `var` Keyword:
   * Declare a local variable using the var keyword and assign it a value. Try changing the type of the variable (e.g., from String to int) and observe the outcome.
6. Challenge with Wrapper Classes:
   * Write a program that uses wrapper classes for int and double. Convert them from primitive types and back again, and demonstrate how to use their methods (like intValue(), doubleValue()).
7. Enums and Constants:
   * Create an enum to represent different days of the week (e.g., MONDAY, TUESDAY, etc.). Print the name and ordinal of each day.
   * Use the `final` keyword to declare constants and print their values.
8. Practice Challenge: Create a PersonDetails Class
   * Create a Java class PersonDetails and practice the following:
        - Primitive fields:
        - Declare variables for age (int), height (double), and isEmployed (boolean).
        - Use final to create a constant:
        - Declare a constant COUNTRY (String) with the value "India".
        - Use var for local variables (Java 10+):
        - In the main method, try using the var keyword to declare local variables for age, height, and isEmployed.
9. Optional Challenge
    * Write a Java program that:
        - Takes input of two numbers from the user.
        - Prints:
        - Their sum.
        - Which one is greater.
        - Whether both numbers are even or not.
